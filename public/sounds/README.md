# Notification Sound Placeholder

This directory should contain a notification sound file named `notification.mp3`.

You can:
1. Use a free sound from https://freesound.org/
2. Generate one using https://www.zapsplat.com/
3. Or use any subtle notification sound (recommended duration: 0.5-1 second)

Recommended sound characteristics:
- Subtle and professional
- Short duration (< 1 second)
- Pleasant tone (not jarring)
- Volume level: moderate

For now, the app will gracefully handle the missing sound file by catching the error silently.
